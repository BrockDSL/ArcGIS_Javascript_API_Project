### Introduction 

ArcGIS is a platform that allows organizations and Individuals to create, manage, and analyze spatial data. It contains desktop and mobile applications, server components and a wide variety of developer tools. The platform can be deployed on the cloud or through their own hosted option ArcGIS Online.This tuturial is about the ArcGIS API for JavaScript which is a lightweight option to embed maps and ArcGIS features.It also allows one to embed their own or others hosted ArcGIS maps.

The tutorial will walk you through Implementing the following features:

  1. Embedding a simple 2D or 3D map of Brock University
  2. Learning how to add widgets by creating a basemap selector to change the map theme
  3. Create a widget that allows the user to add graphics to the map like circles and polygons
  4. Connect an ArcGIS account to implement route mapping 
  5. Embed your own or others hosted ArcGIS map
  
### Setup

First were are going to setup a virtual enviroment that will display and update the web application with every change

  1 . Navigate to https://codepen.io/ and **Sign up** for a free account

  >**Note**: You can sign up with facebook, Email, or even Github to easily have your code written in CodePen be merged to a repository.

  2 . Once Logged in create a new **Pen(document)** by navigating to the **Top left** and clicking Pen

  >**Note**: CodePen offers the ability to also create Projects, Posts, and Collects that all can be added to a Personal Dashboard

  3 . CodePen gives the ability to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all on the same page. All output will be **Automatically generated in   the light gray area**

  4 . If you wish to change the Layout; do so by clicking **Change View** on the Top right and selecting an appropriate Layout. If not we are **Ready to Start**

### 2D and 3D Maps

To start off with out mapping application we will need to add in a **Map** that contains a **basemap** that controls the theme. ArcGis offers a wide variety of default basemaps. Once we have embedded a map we must decide if we want to use a **MapView** for 2D maps or **SceneView** for 3D maps; for the purpose of this tutorial we will be using a MapView.
